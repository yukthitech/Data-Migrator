# DbBackup

DbBackup is a free open source tool for migrating data from source to storage and vice versa.

> The overriding design goal for DbBackup is to have a safe secure back up of 
> data's present in the source. We can migrate data from source to storage, 
> this can be easily done by just passing the source informations (example: 
> for database - driver name, user, password) in a properties file. Please 
> check the section below to get the format of properties file.
